Problem Statement

Crime is a subject of global interest. No matter where you live or how old you are, we all worry about our safety. With crime being all over the news everyday, we get the sense that crime rates keep going up. We want to look at data to find out whether crime has really increased since the 1980’s in different parts of the world. We also want to look at what specific types of crimes have become more or less common and at what regions of the world are more or less dangerous.

Our project is focusing on descriptive analysis to describe some specific conditions found through the dataset.  


Analysis:
We hope to use the dataset to perform a descriptive analysis of global crime over the years, by countries.

Some examples of the questions that we plan to answer with this dataset are:
Has crime increased/decreased in the past 4 decades? Is the trend different in different parts of the world? - We will use the “TotalEvents” column to compare the number of events each year globally and by countries

Which area of the world was the most dangerous in 2020? - Build a heatmap to see the distribution of crime conditions in 2020

With time, which kind of crime activities show an uptrend or downtrend? - We will build a bar chart comparing the type of event by year

Which crime category is the most common in a given period of time? Does the ratio change with time? - In a specific period, such as 2018 to 2021, we can build a pie chart or some other graphs to see the distribution of event roots in the world to see the percentage change of event roots through years?

Have mass shootings become more common in the U.S. in the past 20 years? - We will use the event code to filter the table to only show data related to mass shootings in the U.S. and build a time series chart

Limitation: We have time series dataset to see the crime condition in specific countries by years, but the datasets only contain the crime event categories, Sum of the crime event, and some data normalization or event description, it's hard for us to do predictive analysis due to lacking of parameters. 

Our data set is from Kaggle and you can find it here:
